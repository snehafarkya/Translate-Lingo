## 💡The idea behind this:
I always wonder if we can have a translator, AI listener, and speech converter all in one place. And I made it happen. It’s a beginner project and I welcome you all to contribute in this.

## 🌱Features:
- You can translate any text into 30 different languages and copy that resulting text.

- You can record text and AI will write it for you. You have a pause button and a reset option there as well.

- You can save time by doing the second step.

- Also, you can type and listen to your text

## 📑Future plans:
- Providing voice translation so that users can speak and then translate into another language.

- Adding download functionality in Text-to-Speech so that user can download the AI voice and use it to make reels or videos.

## 😇Support:
